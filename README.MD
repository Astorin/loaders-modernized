## Loaders Modernized

A Space Aged, compact loader the size of a single tile.  This loader should be UPS friendly and does
not use LUA to move items.  It also does not use hidden inserters to move inventory.  However, they
do use power.  So keep those power poles handy!

### Features

- Works in factorio 2.0 and supports Space Age
- Control circuit supported.
- Works with cargo wagons.
- Loaders snap to belts and away from non-belts

### TODO

- Support belts from overhaul mods
- Provide interface for overhaul mods to generate their own loaders
- Support migration from miniloaders mod
- Suport belt stacking
